- 👀 Hiring? I feel confident writing Nodejs + Mongodb aggregation pipelines (these were so hard at some point) + custom front end (however, download the templates to deliver freelance projects).
- 🌱 Falling in love with Cloud because it is no maintanence | AZ 900 ✓ - AZ 104 - AZ 305 - AZ 204 - AZ 400 and more to come.
- 💞️ Learning Dockers on Kubernetes on Raspberry Pi 4.
